        <main>
            <p class="text"> My name is Alexandria Creek and i am originally from a little town called Chatsworth, GA.
                I graduated from Adairsville High School, located in Adairsville, GA. My work experience is very harsh considering i never stayed in a job for very long.
                My main goal is to have a good comfortable career and I really enjoy coding and videogames and my dream is to be able to create a VR system for an even more realistic experience with videogames.
                I always say to myself that I am the one thing in life i can control.......and yes, I did take that from Hamilton....XD
