**Lab01**

  - The first lab included asking a series of yes or no questions by the use of if statements.
  - I also had to explain a little about myself within the HTML and i decorated it(or added the cherry on top) with the CSS.

 **Lab02**

  - Lab 02 consists of the use of arrays to create a 6th and 7th question guessing actual text instead of a simple yes or no. Then these questions if answered correctly with have a rewarding response, but with the use of for loops if the question is answered wrong they wil have a response that intails a clue and why they got it wrong.
  - I have to add more information about myself within the HTML using an unordered list and an ordered list. The ordered list will be a top ten located at the bottom of my page and the unordered list will be where I place my education and job history.
  - My 6th question will be guessing a number and the alert will either tell the user too high or too low if they guessed it wrong, or if they guessed it right then they will be alerted with a hip hip hooraaayyy! They will only have 4 chances to try this, but once these chances are up then I will just go ahead and give them the answer..
  - My 7th question will consist of multiple correct answers and they will be stored inside of an array. The user will have 6 tries to guess the correct answers and if they guess correctly the guesses will end (this also, happens if they run out of attempts..). I will display all the possible outcomes to the user.
  - I am adding in a score keeper to let the user know how many of the questions they got right out of all 7 questions i have in my js.
  - and the cherry on top...CSS to make it all look pretty.
